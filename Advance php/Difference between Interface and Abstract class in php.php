<!-- Interface Vs Abstract Class
.-> An abstract class can have only abstract method or only non-abstract methods or both, but 
all methods of an interface are abstract by default.
.->An abstract class can declare properties/method with access specifier, but interface can declare only constant properties(no other type properities) and methods are by default abstract and public.
.-> A class can inherit only can one abstract class and multiple inheritance is not possible for abstract 
class but A class can implement more than one interface and can achieve multiple inheritance.
.-> if a class contains even a single abstract method that class must be decclared as abstract.
.-> in a abstract class, you can defined as well as it's body methods but in the interface you can only define your methods.
