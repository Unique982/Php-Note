<!-- Class in php  -->
<!-- A PHP class is a group of values with a set of operations to manipulate this values.
Classes facilitate modularity and information hiding. Classes are used to define a new data type.

// Rules
-> The class name can be any valid label.
It can't be php reserved word.
-> A valid class name starts with a letter or underscores, followed by any number of letter, numbers or undorscores.

// Syntax:
class ClassName{
    public $variable_name; // Data member / properties
    public $variable_name;
 function Method_name(){ // methods /Member function 
    body of method;

 }
 function Method_name(parameter_list){
    body of method;

 }
}
Note : You can't assign computed value inside a class.
ex: public $name = "Hari","Sita" 
     public $price = 1001+ 1222
     
2. You can't begin the name of method with a double underscore
ex: function_setName()
