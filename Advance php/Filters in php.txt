// FILTERS in PHP
-> PHP filters are used to validate and sanitize external input. This is especially useful
when the data source contains unknown data, like user input. for example, data form an html form
,cookies, sql statement result etc.

There are two main types of filtering
.-> Validation
-> validation is used to validate or check if the data meets certain qualififcations.
for example, passing in FILTER_VALIDATION_EMAIL will determine if the data is a valid email address
but will not change the data it self.

.-> Sanitization
-> Sanitization will sanitize the data , so it may alter it by removing undersired characters .
for example, passing in FILTER_SANITIZATION _EMAIL will remove characters that are inappropriate for and
email address to contain. that sad, it does not validate the data
